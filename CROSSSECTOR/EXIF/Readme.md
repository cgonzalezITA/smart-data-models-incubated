### About EXIF

Exchangeable image file format (officially Exif, according to JEIDA/JEITA/CIPA specifications) is a standard that specifies formats for images, sound, and ancillary tags used by digital cameras (including smartphones), scanners and other systems handling image and sound files recorded by digital cameras. Exif is supported by almost all camera manufacturers.

The metadata tags defined in the Exif standard cover a broad spectrum:

- Camera settings: This includes static information such as the camera model and make, and information that varies with each image such as orientation (rotation), aperture, shutter speed, focal length, metering mode, and ISO speed information
- Image metrics: Pixel dimensions, resolution, colorspace, and filesize
- Date and time information, digital cameras will record the current date and time and save this in the metadata
- Location information
- A thumbnail for previewing the picture on the camera's LCD screen, in file managers, or in photo manipulation software
- Descriptions
- Copyright information
